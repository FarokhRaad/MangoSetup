# MangoSetup
This repository contains configuration files, automation scripts, and installation helpers for setting up a personalized Arch Linux environment using the MangoWC compositor and a lightweight Wayland focused workflow.

This setup is experimental and highly customized for personal use. It is not intended as a universal plug and play configuration. Anyone attempting to use or adapt this configuration may encounter incompatibilities or unexpected behavior depending on hardware, preferences, and workflow.

Use at your own discretion.
